# COMPSCI 705 HCI Prototype - Socratic Tutor UI

This app can be accessed without installation through the [web app](https://topics-tutor-prototype.vercel.app/). The system requirements for this web app is desktop because it is not currently responsive (extended to work on multiple device types).

## General Functionality

The socratic tutor UI is friendly and in the background we are using a WoZ tool to actually reply to the students so we can evalutate the UI without making a Socratic AI model.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
